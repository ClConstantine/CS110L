# CS 110L: Safety in Systems Programming

## Overview

This repo is my learning material for CS110L, including notes and codes.

In this course, You will learn an fantastic language, Rust.  You may gain a comprehensive understanding of memory leak issues and the improper use of pointers in the code written by C. But the high efficiency of C makes it impossible to be replace by the higher-level language with gc(garbage collection) such as Java in the system programming. Whereas Rust aims at solving the security problems in C without the sacrifice of efficiency .

Thanks for Stanford and Ryan Eberhardt for offering those course material and video.
