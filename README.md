# CS 110L: Safety in Systems Programming

## Overview

This repo is my learning material for CS110L, including notes and codes.

In this course, You will learn an fantastic language, Rust.  You may gain a comprehensive understanding of memory leak issues and the improper use of pointers in the code written by C. But the high efficiency of C makes it impossible to be replace by the higher-level language with GC(garbage collection) such as Java in the system programming. Whereas Rust aims at solving the security problems in C without the sacrifice of efficiency.

Thanks for Stanford and Ryan Eberhardt for offering those course material and video.

## Q&A

Q: Why Rust?

A: My basic understanding of the problem is that Rust can serve as a tool to solve the challenges in system programming. Rust strives to maintain the high efficiency level as C/C++, while improving the safety problems in C programs.

Q: Only Rust?

A: Rust is a tool to deliver the thoughts how we solve those challenges. This course also includes the deep thinking in memory usage of program.
